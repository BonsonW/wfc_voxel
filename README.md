# wfc_voxel
This crate provides a solver for tile-based Wave Function Collapse. It automatically generates rules for map generation from preliminary voxel files. 
Currently, the crate only supports [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/) `XRAW` file formats.

See [Isometric Demo](https://github.com/BonsonW/isometric_demo) for example code.
